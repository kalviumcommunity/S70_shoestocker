Project Title:

Shoe Stocker

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to allow users to log and track their sneaker collections by storing details like brand, model, purchase date, and price. Users will also be able to view their collection in an easy-to-navigate interface.

Key Features:
Add Sneakers to Collection: Users can log their sneaker collection by adding model names, pictures, and purchase dates.

Sneaker Details: Track information like brand, release date, purchase price, and condition.

Market Value Tracker: Show the current market value of each sneaker based on online marketplaces (e.g., StockX, GOAT).

Wishlist: Keep track of sneakers the user wants to add to their collection in the future.

Statistics: Show stats on how much their collection is worth and track appreciation over time.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (or Vanilla JavaScript if you want to keep it really simple)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas) â€“ NoSQL is perfect for this type of project as sneaker data is not complex.

Authentication: (Optional) JWT or just localStorage for a quick MVP.

Why This Project:
Helps sneakerheads organize and manage their sneaker collection, with an added feature of tracking sneaker value over time.
